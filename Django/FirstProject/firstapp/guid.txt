A web framework is  a structured  way of building  web application it is often confused with a library.
the difference is that a library is a collection of functionalities that acomplish a spicific task. 
for example react is a library that contains different functionalities used in web development.
A web framework however does not provide any spicific functionality.
it simply defines  a structure for writting our code. MVT is a concept that explain how a web aplication works and 
interact with client. MVT stands for model, view and template. The model part is responsible for processing data.
It represnts how our data is structured,stored and retrieved. simply put it, deals with the database part of our application.
The view part is rsponsible for handling the user interactions with our application. and the view is where we take user reqests,
process and send back response. simply put it deals with logic part of our application. the template part deals 
with the user inteface or what the user actually sees. It includes the html markup with  placeholder 
for dynamic component we can add from the view parts of our aplication. so mvt divide the responsibities of our 
WEB aplication into three parts. the model for managing data, the view for doing logic and the template for user inteface 
rendering.

in django are 2 ways for create views: function based and class based
